ProChat
=======

ProChat is a VOIP/IM program built in Java, and designed to be a good replacement for Skype. Built on Jabber using the Smack API, ProChat offers a large variety of useful HTML features, such as images, text sizes, text colors, hyperlinks, and automatic subreddit linking.

ProChat is currently in Alpha, but being developed in a feature-first style. Each release, unless noted otherwise, is generally very stable and functional. Any bugs found in a current release should be reported so that I can fix it ASAP.
